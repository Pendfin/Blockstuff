review a article
- So first question is where to find suitable articles? I'm customed to use two starting points: first one is Finna(https://haaga-helia.finna.fi/?userLang=fi&lng=fi) and second one is Keenious (https://keenious.com/explore/).
- I also check the Jufo rating (https://jfp.csc.fi/jufoportaali). Normally if a topic is new I try to find a SLR(systematic literature review) or MLR (multi literature review). The latter includes also some 'grey literature' which must be used carefully in scientific context.

- First scanning Finna with parameters, articles, 2022--> and phishing and infosec as search phrases
- And doing the same with Keenious with same parameters. Then scimming through results..... and in keenious found something interesting
- What I found: Mitigation strategies against the phishing attacks: A systematic literature review--> published in Computers & Security
Volume 132, September 2023, 103387 and available in Elsevier(https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.haaga-helia.fi/science/article/pii/S0167404823002973?via%3Dihub)
 - Checking the classification of publification in Jufo: https://jfp.csc.fi/jufoportaali?Jufo_ID=53963 --> it is 2
- reference: Naqvi, B. et al. (2023) “Mitigation strategies against the phishing attacks: A systematic literature review,” Computers & Security, 132, p. 103387. Available at: https://doi.org/10.1016/J.COSE.2023.103387.
- And because I wasn't able to be present in the lecture I will also pick up one article to review after this literature review
