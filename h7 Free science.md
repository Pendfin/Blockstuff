review a article
- So first question is where to find suitable articles? I'm customed to use two starting points: first one is Finna(https://haaga-helia.finna.fi/?userLang=fi&lng=fi) and second one is Keenious (https://keenious.com/explore/). Then extending it to digital libraries like ACM, IEEE or search engines like Google scholar
- I also check the Jufo rating (https://jfp.csc.fi/jufoportaali). Normally if a topic is new I try to find a SLR(systematic literature review) or MLR (multi literature review). The latter includes also some 'grey literature' which must be used carefully in scientific context.

- First scanning Finna with parameters, articles, 2022--> and phishing and infosec as search phrases
- And doing the same with Keenious with same parameters. Then scimming through results..... and in keenious found something interesting
- What I found: Mitigation strategies against the phishing attacks: A systematic literature review--> published in Computers & Security
Volume 132, September 2023, 103387 and available in Elsevier(https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.haaga-helia.fi/science/article/pii/S0167404823002973?via%3Dihub)
 - Checking the classification of publification in Jufo: https://jfp.csc.fi/jufoportaali?Jufo_ID=53963 --> it is 2, and in scholar ther has been already 58 references to this article
- reference: Naqvi, B. et al. (2023) “Mitigation strategies against the phishing attacks: A systematic literature review,” Computers & Security, 132, p. 103387. Available at: https://doi.org/10.1016/J.COSE.2023.103387.

#### Summarizing:Mitigation strategies against the phishing attacks: A systematic literature review
- Phishing attacks are most common  attack mechanisms used by advesaries
  - it has two main impacts: finacial losses and reputaniol damage
- Three most common used mediums are internet, shor messaging services (SMS) adn voice
  - all these mediums have differnet kind of attacking vectors like websites or smishing
- The targets of phishing lay in all sectors of society. In public sector, banks, insurance, healthcare
- Based on research conducted on mitigations strategies between 2018 and 2023 and being peer reviewed three categories of mitigation strategies were formulated. Also other viewpoints were created based on techniques and attacking vectors
  - Anti-phishing system --> tools, standalone systems, program design approaches (software or physical devices) to prevent phishing attack
    - this category holds most of the reasearch, over 50%   
  - Models and frameworks --> frameworks to govern defencies and models including machine learning
    - this is the secong category with share of 25% 
  - Human-centric mitigation strategies --> training, guidelines, means to impact on human behaviour
    - smallest part of the studies resulting 15%
  - The most commen techonologies or consepts used in mitigation activities are:
    - Machine learning
    - Neural Networks
    - Deep Learning
    - Cryptography
    - Human-centric mitigation strategies
    - others (fuzzy logic, natural language processing, gamification, etc...)

  - The most common technique used is machine learning used in almost half of the studies
  - Different attacking vectors that are targeted with mitigations strategies mention earlier are
    - email, eFax, instant messaging, social media networks, websites, and Wi-Fi. smishing and vishing
    - even though multiple vectors can include more detailed techniques )like man-in-the-middle-attack) the most common vector is website (over half) and second is email and third is general mitigation strategy not addressed to any particular vector

  - Recommendations and guidelines for organizations and end-users are:
    - Follow security policies
      - reporting protocols, staff training procedures
    - Implement access control
      - password policies, login rituals, MFA, tripwires
    - Implement endpoint security
      - host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) agains malware and viruses or email blockers
    - Use training and awareness programs
      - multiple ways to teach and train people from awareness sessions to courses and actively sending phishing emails 
    - Implement policies for devices
      - expected lif expectancy of devices, repair policy 
    - Keep in mind the advice
      - reming not to share any information to outsiders, be vigilant of unknown contacts
    - Use awareness as the mitigation strategy
      - for end-users: use browsers anti-phishing function, keep software up-to-date, don't use the same passwords in multiple locations
    - Use security advice
      - for end-user: dont' use public computers, use string authentication
 - Gaps and open issues challenging mitigating attacks can be divided in two categories: human centric and technology centric
   - Human centric:
     - people take risk--> soon everything is digital and amount of the endpoints per capita increase. This leaves door open to social engineering. So the main question is how mitigated against human behaviour?
     - pro-security trainings--> even though training efforts are increasing the silver bullet for training is yet to be found
   - Technology centric:
      - Need for other methods to prevent phishing--> the most common technique is machine learning, how can we overcome its limitations?
      - Not so common phishing vectors--> most of the mitigation strategies focus on websites and emaila, which are the most common attack vectors But for those less common also needs to be found mitigation strategies if those become more popular    

### a) voluntary - hiw to create a wacth for science articles?
- tried to create this: maybe google scholar would be easiest to create a alert withi googles alert function or scholar's own function
- topic is: scholar.google.com "infosec + phishing" - now we wait and see.....
