### Industrial Cyber Security by Jos Helmich
Jos talked mainly about his contribution in ENISA. ENISA or European union agency for cybersecurity is a European Union agency to maintain and develop regulation, processes, services, certification schemes concerning cybersecurity and be there for Member states and EU bodies. It also is preparing for future challenges and helping other to do it so too.
ENISA has a vital role when creating directives and acts which are the way that joint legislation and interoperatibility is created in Union.
Jos's role in Enisa is to be part of the Advisory group, which main task is to prepare cybersecurity regulations and produce documentation eg. whitepapers about them. Examples of these are: GDPR(General Data Protection Regulation), NIS2(Network and Information Systems Directive, build on NIS), CRA (Cyber Resilience Act) and AIA (Artificial Intelligence Act). The difference between directive and act is that directive is objective that Member States needs to implement the way that suites them best and act is a law that enforces regulation. So directives implementation can vary from country to country and act is the same everywhere. This differs a lot from how the closest tradepartner USA applies regulations. In USA it based on memorandums, which are more like guidance and clarifications or policies and executive orders, which might be temporary directives from the President of The Unitade States. It is important to understand this difference due to the relationship between Europe and America. Even though one might think we're on the same side in a world where everyone tries to have vantage regulation is one of the key assets to control your own playground.

NIS2 is directive which has a large impact on organisations and it enhances supervision, risk management and reporting requirements. Basicaly It is about organisations cybersecurity. NIS2 is seen in manufacturing industry to approach cybersecurity from risk managements poin of view. Priorities differ from office cybersecurity where confidentiality, integrity and availability are the most important capbilities in this order. And when those capabilities being the same in manufacturing cybersecurity the order is different. First one is availability, then integrity and last confidentiality. This paradigm differentation helps you to design e.g. secure environments which are regulation compliant and functional for office and industrial networks.(https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/awareness-campaigns/network-and-information-systems-directive-2-nis2)

CRA being act it is more like a rulebook with rules not to do bad things. It is aimed for cybersecurity of products with digital elements. As it tells more precisely what not to do or do it is recommende to create standards and certifications to adress it. For example the ISO62443 is a good standard tio start with industrial cybersecurity. (Facts checked with help of copilot). So when waiting CRA to be effective it is good to prepare with existing standards.

AIA is also in proposal state and it has a modular and riskbased approach to ensure safe and secure utilization of artificial intelligence. Modular approach means that act consist of separate modules that create a agile entity. The risk approach means that it categorises risks to unacceptable, high risks and AI with specific transparency obligations and minimal risks. Risk framework is build on EU values of fundamental freedoms. (https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/)

Some questions were addressed to Jos. Some regarded responsible party to overwatch these acts, incident reports and its management and who pays Jos's work effort for Enisa :)


### State of Union by Heikki ”zokol” Juva
Source: https://github.com/Zokol/RED-CRA/blob/main/RED%20evaluation.png - this is presenters github-page

Heikki's presentation was about Eurepean Union regulation, mainly RED (Radio Equipoment Directive) and CRA (Cyber Resilience Act). In previous recap is explained differences of directice and act. And also what is CRA. Presentation included also practical aproach towards how regulation is addressed or taken account in manufacturing of equipments that are objects of regulation.
RED is Radio Equipoment Directive. It is about requirements for radio equipment like baby monitors, earphones etc. In this digital era almost all the devices can be plugged into network. Being so, those should be compliant to RED. In the future CRA is replacing RED as being more coercive. But at the moment RED is enforced and CRA is in 'to-be' state. It is assumed that CRA will be enforced 2027 and lessons learned from RED will be part of it.

RED has also device classification in three layers. First on being connected devices, personal data (like video) using device  and financial data using devices. These layers have different kind of requirements which should addressed in documentation. Especially in terms & conditions part of it.

RED has 'good' and 'problematic' requirements. Good ones are requirements to coordinate vulnerabilities between manufacturers and report vulnerabilities, it also enforces input validation, addresses used cryptrography, password practises and for some parts content filtering. The problematic ones are compatibility which allows less secure solutions when compability is required to older versions, security solutions ourtsourcing to vendors or subcontractors meaning that solution can have external device that takes care of security and last one is that only documentation is used for evaluation of the product. And the documentation is delivered by manufacturer. 

Heikki presented how they tested most popular consumer electronic devices that should be compliant to RED. As case example was IP camera for child monitoring, which had sensors for movement, twoway voice capabilities, wifi-connectivity and cloud to store the data. So based on this it was classified for lauyer 1 and 2 but not three.
The device was practically torn to pieces and its flash memory hacked. Some of the findings were positive and some dubious. Positive ones were that updates are enforced, passwords were crypted well enough and the documentation was in most parts good. The Negative ones were that it did'nt have any kind of physical  protection against bypassing the interface and connect directly to device, passwords were hard coded, like you network details, you probably couldn't wipe it totally clean and documentation had direct flaws like challenging GDPR (by using this device you accept that this is not GDPR compliant).

Overall statistics about the top-ten consumer devices had though pretty good statistics. Most of the devices were using TLS and CERT-pinning (network security), most of them don't have operating systems (this is two-bladed sword), most of them are wifi-connected but don't be onlinen all the time, which narrows probabilities to be hacked. Most common issues were that data is not removed, 3rd party access to ypour information and complex manufacturing/supply-chains. Last one meaning that product is usually piled up form pieces of electronics, software and plastics which can all be outsourced to someone in somewhere.

Some questions were addressed again e.g does this mean that  Tietoturvamerkki will be more widely used? Tietoturvamerkki is a guarantee that product is cybersecurity compliant issued by authorities in Finland. Nobody knows will there be govermental certificates. And personally i hope not. If goverment is issuer it will lead us to all sorts of discussion about does it falsify markets and is it the most efficient way to spent taxes. There was also a familier voice asking about man-in-the-middle attacks and especially attacks using perhaps used devices to intercept communication. Also question about flash-drives encryption level was presented. Basically no encryption is standard though secure boot is in use in most of the devices tested.

My own thoughts were between surprise and sadness. Suprise because in positive way it is not everyday and everyones job to hack these devices, it needs skills and access physically to device in most of the cases. Surpised negatively that in many cases customers who acquire these devices are totally unaware of the risk or flaws. Sadness because nobody cares and attitude is somewhere between Who-cares? and Take-the-money-and-run.

Othe path of thoughts with these two presentations is battlefield of market and authorities, customers and citizens sitting in the crossfire and nowhere to duck. More regulations to protect which feels comforting until it makes your life complicated and it feels patronizing. And it is always my own responsibility to buy cheapest and fishiest products

### My experiences on Defender External Attack Surface Management by Joona "Rinorragi" Immonen
The comedy act of how to use Microsoft Defender EASM (External Attack Surface Management) and comparison of benefits against other separate tools.
Defender EASM is tool in Microsoft defender family, even though it is not a part of Microsoft zero trust capabilities. It is still part of the Microsoft offering in Azure.
EASM is basically c-level tool to get more overal picture of the state of cybersecurity in organization. So not too deep diving ín details, some data drilling options and overall dashboard including different kind of apspects of cybersecurity.
Defender EASM monitors your attack surfaces, paths to your most holy treasures, from the attackers point of view. It looks outside to in.
The tool is graphical and it has invenotory and dashborad capabilities. Options for tailoring or adjusting data shown are limited in the dashboards. Basically tool covers all the necessary apects needed but there are two featuresa that are bothering: you don't know what or how it does thinghs and pricing. These are also linked together because the pricing is depended on what you included to be monitored. And because what is does isn't transparent the billing is not transparent. You can guess most activities it does like DNS queries and port scans. It also has links to threat intelligence systems. because it can compare your situation to common scenarios.

Comparison with EASM and OSINT (Ooen Source Intelligence) tools tried to concretize do you need this kind of tool or could you use multiple open-source tool for the same result with maybe lower costs. You can find OSINT-tools eg. https://www.osint.place/ or https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass. In this case it was AMASS that was used. Comparison resulted following insights: 
EASM is more ready to rock and don't need lots of configuration. EASM gives you good user experience, results while scanning and it as getting a free trial period you can have value for your money. Even so if you want to tweak and script AMASS gives you a lot of opportunities and in many cases it is quicker. So the verdict was: depending your desire (and capability) to invest on building your own EASM system it is your choice. 

Questions asked after show were about why AMASS was chosen and other AZURE tools. My own points about the subject are brittle, because it is unknown territory for me. But basically, if any business decision needs to be made you have to know the billing principles. If you don't know were your money is poured you must have a huge business case in implementation or you are out of business. These products show again a huge need in the field of cybersecurity to take account of user and customer centricity. There is potential because topic is relevant in everything you do nowadays.

### Overall thoughts about the event and topic:
The event it self seemed to be organized pretty well, though presentations were not available and stream was just video of the stage. Some voice problems from time to time. Even though looked through the stream atmosphere seemed good. And for the course it fitted like fist in the face.

The topics were interesting (even though the most interesting one for me was flash-talk about European cybersecurity challenge 2024(https://ecsc2024.it/) and Team Finlands experiences in the competition. Seventh out of 37 is not bad.
