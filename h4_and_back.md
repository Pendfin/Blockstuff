###x)

###a) Creating the wallet
 - Using againg my virtual machine Debian (ehiich was set up in homework 1 (https://github.com/Pendfin/Blockstuff/blob/main/h1_perttu.md)
 - updating packkages -->sudo apt-get update
 - installing electrum --> sudo
 - running it
 - Setting it up: automated server connection, new standard wallet, putting seed  and password in safe place, encrypt the wallet also
###b) trying to get some money
-  faucets to be tested
  - today out of order (https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/)
  - seems to be up and running https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/send.php
  - Up and running https://tbtc.bitaps.com/tools and also https://faucet.triangleplatform.com/bitcoin/testnet
      
- Get an address from my wallet ( and yes it is online)--> error wrong volume (don't understand what this means?)
- next faucet: https://faucet.triangleplatform.com/bitcoin/testn- Error: Expected property "1" of type Satoshi, got Number -146625
- my address is correct - if I change it has different kinf of error message
- Test the other site (https://tbtc.bitaps.com/tools)-------diffent kind of messages - not defined
- Check some videos how to solve the problem - total frustration - zero info -should be simple as .....
- taken different approach and actually installing windows wallet for laptop. Wallet called sparrow -->https://sparrowwallet.com/download/ (mainly because i found videos for idiots about using it [https://www.google.com/search?q=idiots+guide+to+set+up+testnet+bitcon+wallet&oq=idiots+guide+to+set+up+testnet+bitcon+wallet&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKAB0gEJMjE5MDJqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:d6be2b75,vid:7JJkLW4SHKQ,st:56](https://youtu.be/7JJkLW4SHKQ))
- After setting it up (just testnet3 version of it) try to receive again
- Same errors ---- checking server status and after testing connections it started to work
- but for a other faucet - same errors
- testing again with linux electrum ---- suprpise it worked, i changed the server before trying it again.
- seems like the only faucet working is https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/send.php
- now i have two wallets in two different environments
- c) Giveway. Move money to another Bitcoin wallet. Choose an amount where the last two digists are 73.
- trying to send it fro my sparrow wallet to electrum wallet

- Pending transaction 'Pay 730 sats to tb1qe9xm3yjx85et64x9ugs6tyewcmhemp7tg9vr32' - pay high fee for transaction
- still waiting while going to have dinner



- ### e)
- e) Explorer. Use a block explorer to analyze a block on the real Bitcoin blockchain.
-  Explain what each value and field means. You only need to analyze the block information and one sample transaction,
-   as a block can contain many transactions. Voluntary bonus: Use a transaction that's interesting,
-   such as one related to a crime or other unusual event.
-   find out Explorer --> https://mempool.space/ (and actually this translates to finnish)
