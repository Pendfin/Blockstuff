# B
Security incident
 Pick a security incident and learn about it. Write briefly about it. Point out the concepts of threat actor, exploit, vulnerability and (business) impact. (You can find writeups about security incidents from Darknet Diaries and Krebs)
 (source https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/99/and https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/100/)
 Pegasus - not an actual incident, but multiple incidents. And maybe still going strong from year 2012. Pegasus is weaponized malware, a product to make business, build to be sold and exploited by state-level operators, maybe anyone who has enough money and power. The customer data of the company is unknown so you can't be sure. Pegasus was spyware to exploit multiple zero-day vulnerabilities and it first emerged on Ios. It being spyware, its main target is individuals and their mobile device. It could be used for reconnaisance purposes, to know where the person was, who the target was communicating. Basically anything that one did with its phone, state secrets, business secrets, criminal activity etc. Only a actors imagination is the limit. 
The exploit had three stages - 
   1 .click the link e.g in text message from your partner. Clicking activates javascript via browser. Javascript exploits a bug in browser's engine. That allows the script upload spyware to phone  
   2. Because the target devices were iPhones they needed to use two another exploits to make it possible to be run in the phone
   3.Actual app is then run on the phone and it uses normal phone features. It can turn on the camera,microphone, read messages or listen calls etc.
   Basically it exploited three unknown vulnerabilities in phone and one for user - the message could be very agressively designed or what would you say when you get message that yous daughter is in the hospital and the link is to provide more information about it.

Fixing the screen with the guide - BIG MISTAKE - went bad to worse uninstalled the existing version and lost it. No new one was availble
But then I found the way to rescale it and fix the shared clipboard through the menu (View and Devices). Always check the version you're playing with.
